We decided to take a short trip to Annecy on the way to Nice. We found the Best Western Plus Hôtel Carlton, a 3 min walk from the station. The location was convenient considering the amount of luggage we had. The hotel room was quaint and clean. Not too far from the old town and Lake Annecy, great location to catch an early morning train.
